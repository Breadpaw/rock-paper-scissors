# Rock, Paper, Scissors

The old rock, paper, scissors game. The really old one. But digital. And for The Odin Project.

## THINGS TO DO

- Make a game class to call it's functions.
- Make the pictures smaller and easier to load.
- Make it responsive...or, well, more responsive perhaps.
- Find a font that doesn't make me want to bleach my eyes.
